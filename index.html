			<p>If you're done reading my bio &amp; content with knowing all about me, then let's move on to the point &mdash; that, this isn't the page you're looking for &mdash; it's just where the journey begins.</p>
			<p>As if I wasn't vague enough &mdash; like a pin of a grenade, or trigger of a gun, or MBR of an OS &mdash; this page is the bare-minimal lift-off spring-board of all its (rather useful) subdomains &amp; links to my other interweb activities.</p>
			<p>My detailed whereabouts are spread across all the links available in here, separated by the interests they correlate to. Typically you shouldn't have to waste more than a couple of seconds to figure out which link to follow, unless you're studying me or the source-code of the site.</p>

				<dt>Minimalism &mdash; close enough!</dt>
				<dd>No truck-load of information, no fancy little prosthetics &mdash; just a clean, Visually &amp; Programmatically minimal homepage. So the entire website fits in just one page &amp; weighs no more than 7KB. B]</dd>
				<dt>No JavaScript &mdash; achievement unlocked!</dt>
				<dd>It's like making a dish awesome without using salt... Nothing against JS (or salt, infact I love 'em both), but just for the kick of HTML5/CSS3 awesomeness! \m/</dd>
				<dt>Originality &mdash; write ALL the codes, all of it!</dt>
				<dd>i.e. no 3rd party library, polyfill or even particularly distinguishable design aesthetics. :)</dd>
				<dt>Proto-responsive Design &mdash; challenge accepted!</dt>
				<dd>Design it in a way that this site doesn't require any radical changes in the interface, to behave properly on any device/platform. It's a work in progress. =_=</dd>
