			<p>If you're through my bio, then let's move on to the point &mdash; this isn't the page you're looking for &mdash; but it's indeed where the journey begins.</p>
			<p>As if I wasn't vague enough &mdash; like the bootloder of a multi-OS system &mdash; this page is the bare-minimal lift-off spring-board of its (rather informative) subdomains of my interweb activities.</p>
			<p>My whereabouts are better found by following the links above, separated by the interests they correlate to. Typically you shouldn't require more than a couple of seconds to figure out which link to follow without any detailed description, unless you're studying me or the source-code of the site  &mdash; else my usability design failed.</p>

			<p>Setting &amp; accomplishing goals &mdash; challenge accepted!</p>

				<dt>Minimalism &mdash; close enough!</dt>
				<dd>No truck-load of information, no fancy little prosthetics &mdash; just a clean, Visually &amp; Programmatically minimal homepage. So the entire website fits in just one page &amp; weighs no more than 7KB. B]</dd>
				<dt>Native HTML5/CSS3 &mdash; look ma, no JS!</dt>
				<dd>It's like making a dish awesome without using salt... Nothing against JS (or salt, infact I love 'em both), but just for the kick of HTML5/CSS3 awesomeness! \m/</dd>
				<dt>Originality &mdash; write ALL the codes, all of it!</dt>
				<dd>i.e. no 3rd party library, polyfill or even particularly distinguishable design aesthetics. :)</dd>
				<dt>Proto-responsive Design &mdash; achievement unlocked!</dt>
				<dd>Designed in a way that this site doesn't require any radical changes in the interface, to behave properly on any device/platform. =_=</dd>
